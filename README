This is the README for project 2 of OS Fall 2019. I finally got my github to work so you can find that here: https://github.com/amycusjohn/OS2

I had a couple warnings that I couldn't get rid of but the program still works
This project is late because I had some personal issues this week. My mom became more ill after her treatment and
I had to help around the house. On Thursday, she had an accident so I was unable to finish the project.
If it is possible, can I have partial credit for this project? It seems like she is doing better so I will to not let
it interfere with my classwork from now on.

./logParse - i inputfile -o outputfile -t time to run
for some reason, it doesn't work if you only use -i or -t by themselves, they must be together
however, default does work
type make to make the program
type make clean to make it clean
